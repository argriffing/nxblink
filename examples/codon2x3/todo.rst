* Redo the Rao-Teh CTBN blinking model sampling code
  to use edge-specific rates rather than branch lengths.
  The point would be to facilitate edge-specific rate parameters
  using sample average statistics of path histories,
  and that these rate parameters could be re-interpreted as branch lengths.
